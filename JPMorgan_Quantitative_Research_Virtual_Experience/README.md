# JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program - Forage 📈

## Overview 🌐

This repository captures my participation and accomplishments in the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program hosted on Forage. The program centered around quantitative research methods, with a focus on analyzing a book of loans to estimate a customer's probability of default.

## Virtual Experience Highlights 🚀

### 1. Quantitative Research Methods 📊

Throughout the virtual experience, I immersed myself in quantitative research methods, gaining hands-on experience in analyzing financial data related to a portfolio of loans. This involved utilizing statistical techniques and mathematical modeling to extract meaningful insights.

### 2. Probability of Default Estimation 🔄

A key aspect of the simulation was estimating the probability of default for customers within the loan portfolio. I applied sophisticated quantitative techniques to assess the risk associated with individual customers. This task required a deep understanding of financial metrics and risk analysis.

### 3. Dynamic Programming for FICO Score Conversion 🛠️

To enhance the predictive capabilities of the analysis, I employed dynamic programming techniques to convert FICO scores into categorical data. This innovative approach allowed for a more nuanced prediction of defaults, contributing to the overall robustness of the quantitative research methodology.

### 4. Data-Driven Decision-Making 📈

The virtual experience emphasized the importance of data-driven decision-making in the field of quantitative research. I honed my skills in interpreting complex financial data and translating it into actionable insights, empowering stakeholders to make informed decisions.
